# Electric Vehicle Market Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction

This project presents a Tableau-powered dashboard that explores the landscape of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. By analyzing over 150,000 EV records, this dashboard provides insights into vehicle type distribution (BEV vs PHEV), manufacturer trends, geographic penetration by state, and model-year growth patterns. The analysis is designed to support stakeholdersâ€”such as policymakers, environmental analysts, and market strategists in understanding adoption trends and identifying opportunities in the growing EV sector.
